TEMPORARY README:

In theory, you don't need much... 
python-pyopenssl
python-crypto
maybe some other stuff...

If you launch ./amsn2.py and it gives an error, that error probably tells you which dependency you need...
You can type ./amsn2.py --help for more info... and the front ends can be selected with -f :
./amsn2.py -f efl
./amsn2.py -f gtk
./amsn2.py -f qt4 
for gtk, you need python-gtk... and for efl, you need the EFL, the python-efl and python-etk

If you want to install the EFL, it's easy go to http://omicron.homeip.net/projects/ and download the easy_e17.sh script :
http://omicron.homeip.net/projects/easy_e17/easy_e17.sh
Then do ./easy_e17.sh -i
It will download the source, automake, configure, make and make install everything into /opt/e17 (so it doesn't 'contaminate' your system).
Once done, go to ./e17_src/BINDINGS/python and type 
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/e17/lib/pkgconfig ./build-all.sh /usr
(this will build and install the python extensions into /usr/python2.X/...)
Then the efl front end should become available...
